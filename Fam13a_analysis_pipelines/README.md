# README

This aim of this project is to analyse and quantify the movement of objects in 2 different video sets:
  * Xenopus - videos of frog emrbryos.
      * [Guidance notebook](analysis/xenopus_analysis_guidance.ipynb) for xenopus analysis
  * hBEC - videos of flourescent beads in a viscous fluid, with currents generated by cells submerged in the fluid.
      * [Guidance notebook](analysis/hbec_analysis_guidance.ipynb) for hbec analysis

## Environment

* Assuming Anaconda is installed, create the conda environment using the locked yaml specification file
  * `conda env create -f environment.lock.yml`

The last command will have created a conda environment called *fam13a-dev*.

#### Activating environment
To activate of the environment from the cli you must use `conda activate fam13a-dev`

#### Updating the environment.
Always try to install packages via conda-forge first as this gives the fewest opportunities for conflicts. Packages can be installed via the command `conda install -c conda-forge <package_name>`.

Once the package is installed, the envorinment files need to be updated. Run `conda env export > environment.lock.yml`. After this, open the `environment.lock.yml` file and remove the prefix that was added at the end. Also add the custom package inport statement `    - -e .` back in at the end.
Please also add the package name manually to the `environment.yml` file.
